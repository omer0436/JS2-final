 * TODO: 10-) Write the code that calculates the total taxes for users whose job type is teacher and    administrator. Add TotalTax to the object and print it as a new array.Sample tax calculations are given below.
  Tax rates are at various levels in the federal and in most of the cantons. But in this question, the tax percentage will be the same for all taxpayers who live in different cantons.
            @FederalTax
            The federal tax rate for individuals in Switzerland is a flat rate of 11.5%.
            Therefore, the federal tax on an income of 5000 CHF is 11.5% x 5000 CHF = 575 CHF.
            @CantonalTax
            The cantonal tax rate in Zurich is 5.5%.
            Therefore, the cantonal tax on an income of 5000 CHF is 5.5% x 5000 CHF = 275 CHF.
            @MunicipalTax
            The municipal tax rate in Zurich is 6%.
            Therefore, the municipal tax on an income of 5000 CHF is 6% x 5000 CHF = 300 CHF.       
            @TotalTax
            The total tax on an income of 5000 CHF in Zurich is 575 CHF + 275 CHF + 300 CHF = 1150 CHF.


            
            The total tax on an income of 40000 CHF in Zurich, Switzerland is 23.0%. This is calculated as follows:
            Federal Tax: 11.5% of 40000 CHF = 4600 CHF
            Cantonal Tax: 5.5% of 40000 CHF = 2200 CHF
            Municipal Tax: 6.0% of 40000 CHF = 2400 CHF
            Total Tax: 4600 + 2200 + 2400 = 9200 CHF
